crank parser, named in honor of everyone that calls me a crank, and also because i like the jason statham movie, is an experimental regex parser engine that is implemented in such a way as to be extensible with support for back/forward references and capturing repetition counts, permitting expressivity for e.g. L = {ww} and L = {a^n b^n c^n}
